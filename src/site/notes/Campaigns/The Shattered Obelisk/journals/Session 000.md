# Session 000:  Setting things up

> [!info] 
> InÂ [Ironsworn:Starforged](https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn-starforged),Â you are a spaceborne hero sworn to undertake perilous quests. You will explore uncharted space, unravel the secrets of a mysterious galaxy, and build bonds with those you meet on your travels. Most importantly, you will swear iron vows and see them fulfilledâ€”no matter the cost.
> 
> A typical Starforged game is designed to played right away. But Starforged believes theÂ **prep is play**. So it allows you to do some quick worldbuilding exercises to help you get started before you start playing.

This session was mostly about setting up the ideas on how to translate the *DnD Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk*  adventure as a Starforged game.

I used AI to help me flesh out most of my initial ideas on how a DnD game can be converted to a Starforged game. A series of conversations helped in filling out gaps in my idea. I also used the AI (swapping between NotebookLM & Gemini) for most of my setup rolls. I asked it to translate any rolls into the Starforged-compatible entities.

A Starforged game or campaign starts with:
1. Choose Your Truths - Decide what is true for your version of the Forge.
2. Create Your Character - Set your characterâ€™s background, abilities, and characteristics.
3. Build a Starting Sector - Create a location to explore at the start of your campaign.
4. Begin Your Adventure - Get your story underway as you face an inciting incident and swear an iron vow.

## Choosing our Truths about the Forge



## Creating a Player Character

> 11. Gear up (p. 112)

I'm not following the above steps in order. I'm starting with the character name.

### Name your character
I set up the player character as [[Characters/wraith\|Kaelen Vashti]] (callsign: Wraith).

### Choose two paths 
I decided to pick up the Bounty Hunter & Sniper assets.

### Create your backstory
I also fleshed out a backstory for Kaelen.

**Kaelen  Vashti** served as a skilled sharpshooter in the planetary militia for a few years before dropping out. Now Kaelen,  a skilled artisan in a small yet thriving community on the edge of the Forge is known for their artistic knick-knacks that the community sold to off-planet traders. But this tranquility was shattered when the [[Crimson Reavers\|Crimson Reavers]], a ruthless band of raiders, descended upon their settlement, leaving behind a trail of fire and despair. Wraith, who had been off-planet during that raid, returned home to find their home reduced to ashes and their comrades slaughtered.

He is a lone wolf hunter archetype bent on vengeance who destroyed his community. (Any resemblance to John Wick or any movie is your overactive imagination. ðŸ˜‰) 


### Write your background vow


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!vow] Kaelen's Background Vow (Difficulty: Epic)
> I vow to eradicate the [[Crimson Reavers\|Crimson Reavers]] from the Forge, leaving no trace of their cruelty. 

</div></div>


### Envision your character

- **Look:** Lean and agile frame; Sharp, watchful eyes; A collection of scars tells a silent story of past encounters; Favors dark, practical clothing that blends into the shadows.
- **Act:** Quiet and observant; Prefers actions to words; Highly focused and driven; A hint of sadness lingers beneath the surface.
- **Wear:** A worn leather jacket, a symbol of their past life; Fingerless gloves allow for precise handling of weapons; A utility belt carries essential tools and a data slate.

### Gear up

Kaelen carries as his inventory in his Spacer Kit:
	- Clothing: Durable, weather-appropriate attire.
	- Rations: Basic food supplies.
	- Tools: A multitool, repair kit, and other essentials.
	- First Aid Kit: Basic medical supplies.
	- Hololink: A device for communication. 
	- Customized Sniper Rifle: Kaelen has named it: *Widowmaker*
	- Hunter's Knife: (used to swear iron vows)
	- Data Slate: With target information, star charts, and communication logs.
	- Disguise Kit 
	- Lockpicks 
	- Silent Weapons: Suppressed pistol or throwing knives.
	- Grappling Hook
	- Binoculars
	- Credits - for purchases

### Board your starship 
Kaelen needs a spaceship to travel on his vengeance journey. So I added a new Command Vehicle for him and named it [[Campaigns/The Shattered Obelisk/assets/Silent Fury\|Silent Fury]]. 

![1-Starship.png](/img/user/Assets/Command_Vehicle/1-Starship.png)

###  Choose your final asset
Starforged gives an option to choose a final asset in addition to the path ones I picked up earlier. So I picked up a Sprite Companion asset and named it [[Campaigns/The Shattered Obelisk/assets/Whisper\|Whisper]].

### Set your stats
Next up was figuring out the stats for Kaelen.  The stats influence how Kaelen interacts with the game's challenges, affecting their success rate and narrative outcomes.

> [!info]- Stats in Starforged
> Starforged uses the following stats: 
>- **Edge**: quickness, agility, and prowess when fighting at a distance.
>- **Heart**: courage, willpower, empathy, sociability, and loyalty.
>- **Iron**: physical strength, endurance, aggressiveness, and prowess when fighting at close quarters.
>- **Shadow**: sneakiness, deceptiveness, and cunning.
>- **Wits**: expertise, knowledge, and observation.

> [!mechanics]+ Stats for Kaelen
>-  ==**Edge: 3**==  - A high Edge score signifies Kaelen's proficiency in quickness, agility, and ranged combat. This aligns with Kaelen's background as a skilled sharpshooter and their SNIPER path, allowing them to excel in situations requiring precision and speed, like starship combat or ranged attacks.
>- ==**Heart: 2**== - Though not their primary strength, a decent Heart score allows Kaelen to navigate social interactions effectively and maintain strong bonds with companions.
>- ==**Iron: 2**== - While not a brawler, Kaelen can withstand physical challenges and hold their own in close combat if necessary.
>- ==**Shadow: 1**== - A low Shadow score suggests that stealth and deception are not Kaelen's preferred methods. Since Kaelen's BOUNTY HUNTER path may require some degree of stealth and cunning to track targets effectively, making this a situational stat. His companion sprite [[Campaigns/The Shattered Obelisk/assets/Whisper\|Whisper]] can augment Kaelen's capabilities in situations where the Shadow stat is relevant. 
>- ==**Wits: 1**== - A low Wits score indicates that Kaelen relies more on instinct and experience than intellectual prowess.

Overall, Kaelen's stat distribution creates a character who is a formidable force in combat, particularly at range. Their moderate Heart and Iron scores provide a balance, while their lower Shadow and Wits suggest areas where they might need to adapt or rely on allies and resources. This creates opportunities for dynamic and engaging gameplay, requiring Kaelen to leverage their strengths and strategize around their weaknesses.

### Set your condition meters

Condition meters measure your characterâ€™s readiness
and status. Initially, health, spirit, and supply meters are set to 5 and momentum to +2. 

> [!mechanics]+ Condition meters
>  Health: 5 
>  Spirit: 5
>  Supply: 5
>  Momentum: 2
