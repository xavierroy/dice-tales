# The Shattered Obelisk

The Shattered Obelisk is an episodic serialised story that I am co-creating with AI tools while playing a solo role-playing game. This story features Kaelen Vashti, a bounty hunter who is looking for vengeance against a band of raiders who destroyed their community. [^jw]

[^jw]: Any resemblance to John Wick or any movie is the result of your overactive imagination. ðŸ˜‰

I am not sure how this story will turn out.
