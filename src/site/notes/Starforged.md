# Welcome to The Forge

In [Ironsworn:Starforged](https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn-starforged), you are a spaceborne hero sworn to undertake perilous quests. You will explore uncharted space, unravel the secrets of a mysterious galaxy, and build bonds with those you meet on your travels. Most importantly, you will swear iron vows and see them fulfilled—no matter the cost.

Starforged is a standalone sci-fi follow-up to Shawn Tomkin's free [[Ironsworn\|Ironsworn]] that has the Forge as the main setting.
