[Ironsworn:Starforged](https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn-starforged) is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG), a type of game where you and your friends gather together to tell a collaborative story. It’s like a choose-your-own-adventure book where the story unfolds based on your choices and the roll of the dice.

Starforged is a science fiction game set in a dangerous galaxy known as the Forge. You are a spaceborne hero sworn to undertake perilous quests. Imagine yourself exploring uncharted space, uncovering ancient secrets, and building bonds with the people you meet along the way. Most importantly, you will swear iron vows and see them fulfilled—no matter the cost.

Starforged is a standalone sci-fi follow-up to Shawn Tomkin's free [[Ironsworn\|Ironsworn]] game.

Think of shows like _Firefly_, _The Mandalorian_, or _Star Trek_ - Starforged draws inspiration from those kinds of stories. The setting is up to you and your group to define. You can decide on the type of technology, the threats you face, and the overall tone of your game.

### How to play ?

Starforged uses a unique dice mechanic to determine the outcome of your actions. You'll need two ten-sided dice (d10) and a six-sided die (d6).

Here's how it works:

1. **Envision the Scene:** First, you describe what your character is trying to do.
    > For example, you might be trying to **Compel** a smuggler to give you information about a hidden space station.
2. **Choose the Relevant Stat:** Based on your approach (like using intimidation or persuasion), you choose one of your character's five stats (Edge, Heart, Iron, Shadow, or Wits) to use as a bonus.
3. **Roll the Dice:** You roll all three dice: two d10s (challenge dice) and one d6 (action die).
4. **Compare the Results:** You compare the highest result on the challenge dice to the sum of your action die plus your chosen stat.
    - **Strong Hit:** If your action die plus your stat is higher than the highest challenge die, you succeed with a strong hit.
    - **Weak Hit:** If your result is equal to or less than the highest challenge die, but still a positive number, you succeed with a weak hit.
    - **Miss:** If your result is zero or a negative number, you miss.
5. **Envision What Happens Next:** Describe how your character reacts based on the dice roll and envision the next action. 

### Who are you playing as?

In Starforged, you build a character that represents you in the game. Your character sheet keeps track of your stats, your health and other resources, and your special abilities called **assets**.

**Assets** are like special skills or resources that give you advantages in the game. You can get assets when you create your character and earn more as you play.

For example, you start with a **STARSHIP**, a command vehicle that allows faster-than-light travel. Other assets could include being a skilled pilot (ACE), a veteran soldier (VETERAN), or having a loyal companion (COMPANION). Each asset card has special abilities you can use during the game.

### Can I see an example of a game?

This example shows how dice rolls and descriptive storytelling combine to create exciting and unpredictable outcomes in Starforged.

> [!example]+ Caught in a Gravity Well
> Imagine your spaceship is caught in the gravity well of a dying star. You need to escape before it's too late!
>- **The Scene:** You describe how your character races to the cockpit, trying to restart the damaged engines while the ship shakes violently.
>- **The Move:** You decide to **Undertake an Expedition** to navigate through the treacherous gravity well. The rank of this Expedition is dangerous.
>- **The Roll:** The game master (GM) tells you to roll +Wits (because you're relying on your knowledge and skill to escape). You add your Wits stat (let's say it’s 2) to your d6 roll (let's say you roll a 3). Your result is 5. You roll your challenge dice and get a 6 and a 9.
> - **The Outcome:** Unfortunately, your result is less than the highest challenge die (9), so you suffer a weak hit. The move tells you to mark progress twice on your progress track, but you also face a setback. The GM decides that your engines sputter and die, leaving you stranded in the gravity well with limited time to fix them!
> *Now you decide what happens: Do you perish or do you find a way to escape?*

Here are two examples of non-deadly yet dangerous situations in a Starforged game.
> [!example]+ Trapped in a Derelict
> Your character is exploring a derelict spaceship, hoping to scavenge valuable parts. You enter a new zone, and the GM asks you to roll on the **Engineering Derelict Peril** table. You roll and get *Unstable or Failing Power Core*.
> 
> This is dangerous because the power core could explode, causing serious harm to your character and destroying the valuable salvage. It's not immediately deadly, as you have a chance to escape or contain the damage.
> 
> To resolve this situation, you could:
> - **Face Danger +Wits** to try to shut down the power core before it explodes.
> - **Secure an Advantage +Shadow** to find a hidden escape route.
> - **Check Your Gear** to see if you have any tools or equipment that could help you stabilize the core.
> The outcome of your actions, determined by the dice rolls, would decide whether you successfully avoid the danger or suffer harm or other setbacks.

> [!example]+ A Tense Negotiation
> 
> Your character is trying to negotiate a treaty between two warring factions in a neutral space station. Tensions are high, and any misstep could reignite the conflict. This is a non-action scene where the danger lies in the potential for violence to erupt.
> 
> To navigate this situation, you could:
> - **Compel +Heart** to appeal to the factions' shared interests and find common ground.
> - **Secure an Advantage +Iron** to demonstrate your strength and resolve, deterring any aggressive actions.
> - **Gather Information +Shadow** to uncover any hidden agendas or saboteurs trying to undermine the negotiations.
> Again, the outcome of your moves and the dice rolls would determine whether you successfully broker peace or make the situation worse.

Remember, the game encourages you to use your imagination and the provided mechanics to tell a dynamic and engaging story.
