# The Shattered Obelisk

![tso-banner.png](/img/user/Campaigns/The%20Shattered%20Obelisk/images/tso-banner.png)

The Shattered Obelisk is my reimagination of the DnD adventure, [Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk](https://dndstore.wizards.com/us/en/product/820931/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk-digital-plus-physical-bundle) as a Starforged adventure. 

I was looking at introducing Max and his friends as a DnD adventure. I felt they would like the adventuring part of it and also the newer horror-styled tone of the Underdark. 

Then  I wondered what if I could reimagine this as a space-faring adventure while trying to maintain the DnD storyline but with Starforged mechanics. I also wanted to run this game with AI acting as a guide and storyteller.
