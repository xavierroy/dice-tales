# Welcome to Tales of the Dice 👋🏾

A few years ago, I delved into the world of tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) and quickly fell in love with Shawn Tomkin's Ironsworn. The game's versatility and its unique "play-to-see-what happens" mechanics, where decisions and dice rolls shape the narrative, captivated me.

I primarily enjoy playing Solo RPGs, which means I embark on these adventures by myself. This website serves as a platform to chronicle my solo gaming experiences, transforming my gameplay sessions into a quasi-narrative format.

I will be playing Shawn Tomkin’s Ironsworn and its variants:
* [Ironsworn](https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn) - the base game
* [[Starforged\|Ironsworn: Starforged]] - a standalone, sci-fi evolution of the Ironsworn RPG
* [Sundered Isles](https://tomkinpress.com/pages/sundered-isles) - a seafaring expansion for Ironsworn: Starforged

The beauty of the Ironsworn games is that you can decide what happens based on the dice rolls. That's the reason behind the site's name.
