# Welcome to Tales of the Dice üëãüèæ 
![dice.jpg](/img/user/Images/dice.jpg)
There's a unique thrill in forging your own path, facing down dangers, and crafting a story all on your own. Welcome to my solo Role Playing Game (Solo RPG) adventures. This website serves as a platform to chronicle my solo gaming experiences, transforming my gameplay sessions into engaging stories, weaving together the events of my adventures. The term for this type of writing is **Actual Play Fiction (APFic)**.[^apfic]

[^apfic]: [Actual Play Fiction](https://www.gatling.xyz/actual-play-fiction/) was coined by Tavon Gatling.

A few years ago, I delved into the world of tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) and quickly fell in love with Shawn Tomkin's Ironsworn. Ironsworn is a tabletop role-playing game set in a dark, Nordic-inspired world. The game's freedom to 'play-to-see-what happens' was a revelation. I loved how the game's oracles and dice rolls could send my character down unexpected paths, creating truly unique stories. The outcomes are dictated by the dice, so each story is a direct result of those rolls. 

'Tales of the Dice' reflects that element of chance and discovery. Dive into my stories and see where the dice take me!"

I will be playing Shawn Tomkin‚Äôs¬†Ironsworn and its variants and writing about them:
* Ironsworn¬†- the base game
* [[Games/Starforged\|Ironsworn: Starforged]] - a standalone, sci-fi evolution of the Ironsworn RPG
* Sundered Isles - a seafaring expansion for Ironsworn: Starforged
