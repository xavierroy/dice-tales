## Welcome to Tales of the Dice 👋🏾

I started playing tabletop role playing games (TTRPGs) a couple of years back, especially since I discovered Shawn Tomkin’s Ironsworn TTRPG. I loved the versatility and the play-to-see-what happens mechanics. 

Mostly, I play Solo RPGs – meaning I’ll be playing these games alone. This site is an attempt to convert my gameplays into a quasi-narrative style.

I will be playing Shawn Tomkin’s Ironsworn and its variants:
* [Ironsworn](https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn) - the base game
* [[Starforged\|Ironsworn: Starforged]] - a standalone, sci-fi evolution of the Ironsworn RPG
* [Sundered Isles](https://tomkinpress.com/pages/sundered-isles) - a seafaring expansion for Ironsworn: Starforged
