# Bounty Hunter (Path)

## Abilities:
- [ ] When you take a bounty contract and [Swear an Iron Vow](Moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) to see it done, add +1. On a strong hit, youâ€™ve got a solid lead and may mark progress on the quest. When you [Fulfill Your Vow](Moves/quest/fulfill_your_vow) on a hunt, make the legacy reward one rank higher (1 extra box if already epic).

- [ ] When you [Gather Information](Moves/adventure/gather_information) related to a bounty, add +1. On a match, you reveal a surprising or sinister aspect of the contract; envision what you discover, and choose one.

 * Forge ahead: Mark progress on the quest. If you scored a strong hit with a match, also take +2 momentum.
 * Change loyalties: [Forsake Your Vow](Moves/quest/forsake_your_vow) and mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track.

- [ ] When you [Take Decisive Action](Moves/combat/take_decisive_action) in a fight against a bounty target or their agents, you may reroll one challenge die.
