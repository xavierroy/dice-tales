# Welcome to Tales of the Dice 👋🏾

A few years ago, I delved into the world of tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) and quickly fell in love with Shawn Tomkin's Ironsworn. The game's versatility and its unique "play-to-see-what happens" mechanics, where decisions and dice rolls shape the narrative, captivated me.

I primarily enjoy playing Solo RPGs, which means I embark on these adventures by myself. This website serves as a platform to chronicle my solo gaming experiences, transforming my gameplay sessions into a quasi-narrative format.

The beauty of the Ironsworn games is that you can decide what happens based on the dice rolls. That's the reason behind the site's name.

I will be playing Shawn Tomkin’s Ironsworn and its variants:
* Ironsworn - the base game
* [[Starforged\|Ironsworn: Starforged]] - a standalone, sci-fi evolution of the Ironsworn RPG
* Sundered Isles - a seafaring expansion for Ironsworn: Starforged

> [!important] Use of AI in this site
> I'm using AI as a collaborative storytelling partner.
> 
> **==My role in this project is to serve as the game master.==** I'll set the scene, determine the initial plot points, and roll the dice to introduce random elements into the story. Once I've established the basic framework, **I'll provide the AI with the dice results and my thoughts on how I want the story to unfold.**
> 
> The AI will then generate the narrative based on these inputs. After the AI has finished its draft, **I'll review the story for clarity, coherence, and consistency with my original vision.** Any necessary revisions will be made to ensure a polished final product.
> 
> **To maintain transparency,** I'll publish each episode along with the dice rolls and my thoughts from the initial planning stage.
