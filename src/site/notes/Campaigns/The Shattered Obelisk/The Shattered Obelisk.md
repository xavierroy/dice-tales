# The Shattered Obelisk

The Shattered Obelisk is a reimagination of the DnD adventure: **[[Campaigns/The Shattered Obelisk/lore/Phandelver and Below_ The Shattered Obelisk\|Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk]]**. This adventure is an update to the Lost Mines of Phandelver, one of the best introductory adventures into the world of DnD.

I was looking at introducing Max and his friends to this updated storyline. I felt they would like the adventuring part of it and also the newer horror-styled tone of the Underdark. 

I wondered if this could be adapted as an Ironsworn adventure. I loved the mechanics and gameplay of Ironsworn. So I thought this could be adapted as an Ironsworn game. And then I wondered what if I could reimagine this as a space-faring adventure while trying to maintain the DnD storyline but with Starforged twists.

I also wanted to get the help of AI to help me with some of the gameplay.
