# Whisper (Companion)




## Abilities:
- [x] Your sprite companion alters its delicate, crystalline form to fly, swim, or scurry, and can covertly navigate even the harshest of environments. When you make a move by sending it to perform trickery (such as creating a distraction, sneaking into a protected location, or stealing an object) add +its health.

- [ ] You are attuned to the resonance of the sprite's crystalline structure, and can communicate with it at a distance and perceive through its senses. When you [Secure an Advantage](Moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage) by observing a situation from its perspective, or remotely [Gather Information](Moves/adventure/gather_information), add +its health.

- [ ] With a moment's rest, the sprite can mend its form and return automatically to max health.
