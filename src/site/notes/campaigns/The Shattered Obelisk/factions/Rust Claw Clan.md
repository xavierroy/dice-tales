# Rust Claw Clan

![rust-claw-logo.jpg](/img/user/campaigns/The%20Shattered%20Obelisk/images/rust-claw-logo.jpg)
### **Faction:**

- **Name:** The Rust Claw Clan. This name evokes their affinity for salvaged and repurposed technology, often corroded and rusty.
- **Type:** Fringe Group (specifically raiders).
- **Influence:** Localized, confined to a single sector.
- **Legacy:** Relics (referring to their obsession with precursor technology).
- **Identity:** Horde.
- **Name Template:** Horde of the Relics.

### **Characteristics:**

- **Symbol:** A stylized claw clutching a gear, both rendered in a rusty, corroded style.
- **Starships:** A cobbled-together fleet of salvaged and repurposed vessels, heavily modified with mismatched components and jury-rigged systems.
- **Weapons:** Favour crude energy weapons and modified mining tools, often prone to malfunction.
- **Culture:** Guided by superstition and a belief that precursor technology holds the key to power.

### **Drives:**

- **Scavenge and hoard precursor relics:** They believe these relics possess immense power and strive to acquire them, even if they don't fully understand their function.
- **Raid settlements for resources and slaves:** They are driven by a need to survive and expand their influence, preying on weaker settlements.
- **Appease their enigmatic leader:** This leader, possibly a mutated goblin or a charismatic figure claiming to understand precursor technology, holds sway over the clan.

### **Tactics:**

- **Overwhelm with numbers:** They rely on swarming tactics, utilizing their large numbers to overwhelm their foes.
- **Utilize salvaged technology:** Employ crude energy weapons, repurposed mining equipment, and hastily assembled vehicles to gain an advantage.
- **Exploit fear and superstition:** They use their fearsome appearance, strange technology, and ritualistic practices to intimidate their opponents.

- **Rust Claw Scavengers:** A patrol of Rust Claw goblins, heavily armed with modified mining tools and jury-rigged energy weapons, explore the vault, searching for valuable relics.
- **Rust Claw Fanatics:** A group of goblins obsessed with a particular precursor device, perhaps a malfunctioning energy source or a corrupted communication array. Their attempts to activate or understand the device could trigger unforeseen consequences within the vault.
### **Relationship with the Crimson Reavers:**

Their relationship with the Rust Claw Clan could be defined as:

- **Antagonistic:** The Crimson Reavers, perhaps a more established and organized raider group, view the Rust Claw Clan as rivals for resources and territory. Clashes between the two factions could be frequent and brutal.

**Possible Connection:**

- **Shared Origin:** The Rust Claw Clan could be a splinter group that broke away from the Crimson Reavers, perhaps due to a disagreement over leadership or ideology. They might share certain tactics and cultural elements, but with distinct differences stemming from their obsession with precursor technology.
- **Power Vacuum:** The Crimson Reavers, after suffering a major defeat, have lost control of the vault. Sensing an opportunity, the Rust Claw Clan, led by their cunning leader, moves in to claim the site for themselves. The players, perhaps seeking to secure the vault for their own purposes or for a rival faction, must now contend with the Rust Claw Clan amidst the dangers of the vault.
