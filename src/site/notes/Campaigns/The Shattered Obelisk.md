# The Shattered Obelisk

The Shattered Obelisk is an episodic serialised story that I am co-creating with AI tools while playing a solo role-playing game. This story features [[Characters/wraith\|Kaelen Vashti]], a bounty hunter who is looking for vengeance against a band of raiders who destroyed their community. [^jw]

[^jw]: Any resemblance to John Wick or any movie is the result of your overactive imagination. ðŸ˜‰

I am not sure how this story will turn out. The roll of the dice will determine the directions that this story will take.

> [!important] Use of AI in this site
> I'm using AI as a collaborative storytelling partner.
> 
> **==My role in this project is to serve as the game master.==** I'll set the scene, determine the initial plot points, and roll the dice to introduce random elements into the story. Once I've established the basic framework, **I'll provide the AI with the dice results and my thoughts on how I want the story to unfold.**
> 
> The AI will then generate the narrative based on these inputs. After the AI has finished its draft, **I'll review the story for clarity, coherence, and consistency with my original vision.** Any necessary revisions will be made to ensure a polished final product.
> 
> **To maintain transparency,** I'll publish each episode along with the dice rolls and my thoughts from the initial planning stage.
